# Fantasy-Overwatch

Group: Shane Tremel, Solomon Paprocki

**MVP**

+ List of players… csv file (done)
+ Draft
+ Search (sort) by name, team, etc
+ View players, stats, and user team
+ Be able to save user team
+ hold user teams
+ Option to have multiple people in draft, or just solo (if solo, random select the rest of teams) 

**Stretch Goals**

+ Menus made with GUI
+ Adding an option to login as a mod or a user (mod could change scores, I would also add a scoring system if I did this, this would make the app actually functional) use hashing for password
+ add a cpu that auto drafts a team
+ game class that simulates a game (give each play random # of points using the scoring system, user should be able to see all the stats for each player)
