**MVP**

+ List of players… csv file ✔
+ Draft (use arraylists more than likely) ✔
+ Search (sort) by name, team, etc ✔
+ View players, stats, and user team (Maybe polymorphism) ✔
+ Use enums to hold the 3 roles, and the 20 ow league team ✔
+ Interfaces for each of the 3 roles --> Interface for all users (regular + mod) ✔
+ Be able to save user team ✔
+ hold user teams ✔
+ Option to have multiple people in draft, or just solo (if solo, random select the rest of teams)  ✔
+ Have a tournament generic class ✔
+ Utilize a sort method that uses an anonymous class ✔

**Stretch Goals**

+ Menus made with GUI X
+ Adding an option to login as a mod or a user (mod could change scores, I would also add a scoring system if I did this, this would make the app actually functional) use hashing for password X
+ add a cpu that auto drafts a team ✔
+ game class that simulates a game (give each play random # of points using the scoring system) ✔
