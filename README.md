MVP

-View players, stats, and user team
-Be able to save user team
-Use abstraction to hold user teams
-Option to have multiple people in draft, or just solo (if solo, random select the rest of teams) 

Stretch Goals
-Menus made with GUI
-Adding an option to login as a mod or a user (mod could change scores, I would also add a scoring system if I did this, this would make the app actually functional) use hashing for password
